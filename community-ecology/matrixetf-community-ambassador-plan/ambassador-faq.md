Yes. If you have 500 Points, you can get a "MatrixETF Army I" NFT Badge, once you have this Badge, you can have another 100 MDF Rewards Monthly.

### 12.Why is my Point score lower than expected?

We recommend more meaningful and original content, you’d better have your own idea and opinion, rather than simply copy our white paper/article/announcement contents.

**Quantity is not equal to Quality.** The more you created low qualified contents, won’t bring you with higher scores, instead you will probably degrade your level.

Once again we mention our selection standard, based on the previous standard, we will focus more on the points as below:

* Focus on the quality of your posts, high qualified posts will help to gain higher scores
* Interesting contents will more easy to share in the community
* We hope you can expand your community relationship, build strong dynamic communities and increase your social media followers
* Improve your aesthetic ability and comprehension on crypto market, create more encrypted favorable contents
* Contents for improving MatrixETF product’s utility and adoption
