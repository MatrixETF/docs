# DAO

DAO represents a decentralized autonomous organization, which gathers together for a mission and cooperates according to a series of rules on the blockchain.

The biggest advantage of DAO is that it is more transparent than traditional companies, and is easy to participate. With the development and popularization of blockchain technology, DAO has gradually become an emerging part of the DeFi \(Decentralized Finance\). Many communities now solve various problems through decentralized collaborative operations.

For MatrixETF, no one is responsible for MatrixETF. The development of MatrixETF is decided by the consensus of community voters. Anyone can contribute to a new proposal and existing proposals.
