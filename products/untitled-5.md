# Farming & Pool

Farming is an innovative way in the DeFi ecology. By mining, holders can gain income other than the token. Meanwhile, locking and mining can also effectively adjust the market supply and demand of the token. With the continuous expansion of TLV funds in Farming and Pool, it also represents the network value and market recognition of the platform.

* Farming: to provide liquidity for MDF/ETH, ETFs and other trading pairs to gain handling fees, and participate in MDF mining by providing liquidity LP Tokens to make additional profits.
* Pool: to deposit in MDF and ETFs token to get Staking rewards.
